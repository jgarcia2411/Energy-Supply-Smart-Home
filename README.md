# Energy-Supply-Smart-Home
Keras - LSTM and Genetic Algorithms for hyper-parameters optimization 


This work is part of a project for our applied machine learning class. We decided to work on this model because matching electrical energy consumption with the right supply level is crucial because excess electricity supplied cannot be stored unless converted to other forms, which incurs additional costs and resources. At the same time, underestimating energy consumption could be fatal, with excess demand overloading the supply line and even causing blackouts. A model like this can help the consumers better understand how their energy will be consumed in their homes or offices. 

We implemented Keras - LSTM recurrent neural network to forecast the energy comsumption of a smart home, based on weather parameters. We used this data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information). This medium article (https://kamranarshad333.medium.com/predicting-energy-demand-from-consumption-data-25a59c728906) shows our results and you can find the code in this repository.
