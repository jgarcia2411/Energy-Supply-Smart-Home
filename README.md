## What & Why
Forecasting electricity demand and consumption is critical for energy companies. It provides accurate tools for resource management, investment portfolio, and power consumption and usage planning. Modern buildings are benefitted from consumption forecasts and are adopting new technologies to collect energy use data. This capstone project was presented in the Applied Machine Learning class and is oriented to build an RNN-LSTM model to forecast power demand of a residential building. Additionally, hyper-parameters tuning was achieved using genetic algorithm. In this project, we use data to explore the question: Given recent power demand, what is the expected demand in a future interval of time? To solve this problem, we built a RNN-LSTM model that takes the previous 7 days of power demand to forecast the next day usage.

## Data:
